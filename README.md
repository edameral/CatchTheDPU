# CatchTheDPU
Android Game Project Prepared in Java Language

A tiny application I developed in Android Studio using Java.
It includes 3 basic screens: user login screen, game screen and score screen. 
It contains an audio file for the game's background, a DPU (logo) image, and status blocks for time control.
The aim of the game is to click on the DPU (school logo) that appears randomly on the screen within a certain time. 
Points are calculated based on the number of clicks.
